# SecurityOps-KQL-Hunting-and-Detection-Queries

# Overview

This repository is dedicated to sharing clear, effective, and actionable Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries that support security operations teams in strengthening their detection and hunting capabilities. Each query is written to be easily understood, adaptable, and applicable across Microsoft Security product logs.

# Purpose

The goal of this project is to help security analysts enhance visibility and detection coverage in their environments. While not all suspicious behavior triggers built-in alerts, many activities become highly detectable when logs are properly queried.

This repository provides:

Detection Rules – Queries designed to identify suspicious or malicious activity.

Hunting Queries – Investigative queries for proactive threat hunting.

Visualizations – KQL-based charts and views to support analytical workflows.

# Usage

All queries are free for anyone to use and adapt into their own Microsoft Sentinel/Microsoft Defender environments. The intention is to support the community by offering practical examples that improve security outcomes.

# Contributions

Contributions from the community are welcome. Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues to discuss new ideas or enhancements.
